 Answer the questions


 Given bracket sequence: [((())()(())]]
 Can this sequence be considered correct?
 Answer: No
 Why?
 We have an inequality in the number of brackets.
 Either we must replace the first parenthesis with a square bracket, or we must replace the second from the end square bracket with a round bracket
 Examples:
 [**[**(())()(())]]

 [((())()(())**)**]
